      '<p align="justify">Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision. Until recently, detection models were typically limited to a small, fixed set of semantic categories, \
because obtaining localized training data with large or open label spaces is costly and time-consuming. This has changed with the development of powerful language encoders and contrastive image-text training. These models learn a shared \
representation of image and text from loosely aligned image-text pairs, which are abundantly available on the web. By leveraging large amounts of image-text \
data, contrastive training has yielded major improvements in zero-shot classification performance and other language-based tasks [39, 19, 44]. <br><br>\
Many recent works aim to transfer the language capabilities of these models to object detection [12, 26, 45, 46, 20]. These methods, for example, \
use distillation against embeddings of image crops [12], weak supervision with image-level labels [46], or self-training [26, 45]. Here, we provide a simple \
architecture and end-to-end training recipe that achieves strong open-vocabulary detection without these methods, even on categories not seen during training. <br><br> \
We start with the Vision Transformer architecture [22], which has been shown to be highly scalable, and pre-train it contrastively on a \
large image-text dataset [44, 19]. To transfer the model to detection, we make a minimal set of changes: We remove the final token pooling layer and instead attach a lightweight \
classification and box head to each transformer output token. Open-vocabulary classification is enabled by replacing the fixed classification layer weights with the class-name embeddings obtained from the \
text model [2] (Figure 1). We fine-tune the pre-trained model on standard detection datasets using a bipartite matching loss [6]. Both image and text model are fine-tuned end-to-end. \
<br><br>We analyze the scaling properties of this approach and find that increasing model size and pre-training duration continue to yield improvements in detection performance beyond 20 billion image-text pairs. \
This is important since imagetext pairs, in contrast to detection data, are abundant and allow further scaling. <br><br>A key feature of our model is its simplicity and modularity. Since the image and text components \
of our model are not fused, our model is agnostic to the source of query representations. We can therefore use our model without modification as a one-shot detection learner simply by querying it with imagederived \
embeddings. One-shot object detection is the challenging problem of detecting novel objects solely based on a query image patch showing the object [16,4,31]. The image-conditioned one-shot ability is a powerful extension to \
text-conditioned detection because it allows detecting objects that are difficult to describe through text (yet easy to capture in an image), such as specialized technical parts. Despite using a generic architecture \
not specialized for this problem, we improve the state of the art for one-shot detection on unseen COCO categories (held out during training) from 26.0 to 41.8 AP50, an improvement of 72%. \
<br><br>For open-vocabulary text-conditioned detection, our model achieves 34.6% AP overall and 31.2% AP<sub>rare</sub> on unseen classes on the LVIS dataset. \
<br>In summary, we make the following contributions:\
<ol type="1">\
  <li>A simple and strong recipe for transferring image-level pre-training to openvocabulary object detection.</li>\
  <li>State-of-the-art one-shot (image conditional) detection by a large margin.</li>\
  <li>A detailed scaling and ablation study to justify our design.</li>\
</ol> We believe our model will serve as a strong baseline that can be easily implemented in various frameworks, and as a flexible starting point for future \
research on tasks requiring open-vocabulary localization. We call our method \
<i>Vision Transformer for Open-World Localization</i>, or <i><b>OWL-ViT</b></i> for short.  </p>',

  st.markdown(
      '<p align="justify"><b>Contrastive Vision-Language Pre-Training.</b>The idea of embedding images and text into a shared space has been used to achieve “zero-shot” generalization \
for a long time [10,36,40]. Thanks to innovations in contrastive losses and better architectures, recent models can learn consistent visual and language representations from web-derived image and text \
pairs without the need for explicit human annotations. This vastly increases the available training data and has led to large improvements on zero-shot classification benchmarks [33,19,44,32]. While any of \
the recent image-text models are compatible with our approach, our model and dataset are most similar to LiT [44] and ALIGN [19].<br></br>\
<b>Closed-Vocabulary Object Detection.</b> Object detection models have been traditionally formulated for closed-vocabulary settings. Initially, “one-stage” and “two-stage” detectors, such as SSD [28] \
and Faster-RCNN [34] respectively, proliferated. More recently, DETR [6] showed that object detection can be framed as a set prediction problem, trained with bipartite matching, and achieve competitive \
results. Notably, such architectures do not require region proposal generation or non-maximum suppression. Follow-up works have proposed more efficient variants of DETR [48,41,37], including architectures \
without a “decoder-stage” [9]. Our work also simplifies DETR, in that we do not use a decoder. Compared to [9], which uses additional “detection” tokens, we further simplify the model by predicting one object \
instance directly from each image token.<br></br>\
<b>Long-Tailed and Open-Vocabulary Object Detection.</b> To go beyond a closed vocabulary, fixed classification layers can be replaced by language em-beddings to create open-vocabulary detectors [2]. \
Open-vocabulary object detection has recently seen much progress from combining contrastively trained image-text models and classic object detectors [12,20,26,45,46,42]. The main \
challenge in this task is how to transfer the image-level representations of the image-text backbone to detection despite the scarcity of localized annotations for \
rare classes. Making efficient use of the image-text pre-training is crucial since it allows for scaling without the need for expensive human annotations. Various approaches have been proposed. \
<b>ViLD</b> [12] distills embeddings obtained by applying CLIP or ALIGN to cropped image regions from a class-agnostic region proposal network (RPN). The RPN, however, limits generalization performance \
on novel objects, which is exacerbated by ViLD\'s two-step distillationtraining process. Multistage training is also used by <b>RegionCLIP</b>, which generates pseudo-labels on captioning data, followed by \
region-text contrastive pretraining, and transfer to detection. In contrast, our method fine-tunes both image and text models end-to-end on publicly available detection datasets, which simplifies training \
and improves generalization to unseen classes. <b>MDETR</b> [20] and <b>GLIP</b> [26] use a single text query for the whole image and formulate detection as the phrase grounding problem. This limits the \
number of object categories that can be processed per forward pass. Our architecture is simpler and more flexible in that it performs no image-text fusion and can handle multiple independent \
text or image-derived queries. <b>OVR-CNN</b> [42] is most similar to our approach in that it fine-tunes an image-text model to detection on a limited vocabulary and relies on image-text pre-training \
for generalization to an open vocabulary. However, we differ in all modelling and loss function choices. We use ViT [22] instead of their ResNet [15], a DETR-like model instead of their Faster-RCNN [34] \
and image-text pre-training as in LiT [44] instead of their PixelBERT [18] and visual grounding loss. Orthogonal to our approach, <b>Detic</b> [46] improves long-tail detection performance with weak supervision \
by training only the classification head on examples where only image-level annotations are available. </br><br>We note that in our definition of <i>open-vocabulary</i> detection, object categories \
may overlap between detection training and testing. When we specifically refer to detecting categories for which no localized instances were seen during training, we use the term <i>zero-shot</i>.</br><br>\
<b>Image-Conditioned Detection.</b> Related to open-vocabulary detection is the task of image-conditioned detection, which refers to the ability to detect objects matching a single <i>query image</i> which shows \
an object of the category in question [4,16,7,31]. This task is also called <i>one-shot object detection</i> because the query image is essentially a single training example. Image-based querying allows openworld \
detection when even the <i>name</i> of the object is unknown, e.g. for unique objects or specialized technical parts. Our model can perform this task without modifications by simply using image-derived instead of \
text-derived embeddings as queries. Recent prior works on this problem have focused mainly on architectural innovations, for example using sophisticated forms of cross-attention between the query and target image \
[16,7]. Our approach instead relies on a simple but large model and extensive image-text pre-training.\

        '<p align="justify"><b>Architecture.</b> Our model uses a standard Vision Transformer as the image \
encoder and a similar Transformer architecture as the text encoder (Figure 1). \
To adapt the image encoder for detection, we remove the token pooling and final \
projection layer, and instead linearly project each output token representation \
to obtain per-object image embeddings for classification (Figure 1, right). The \
maximum number of predicted objects is therefore equal to the number of tokens \
(sequence length) of the image encoder. This is not a bottleneck in practice since \
the sequence length of our models is at least 576 (ViT-B/32 at input size 768 × \
768), which is larger than the maximum number of instances in today’s datasets \
(e.g., 294 instances for LVIS [13]). Box coordinates are obtained by passing \
token representations through a small MLP. Our setup resembles DETR [6], but \
is simplified by removing the decoder.</br></br><b>Open-vocabulary object detection.</b> For open-vocabulary classification of \
detected objects, we follow prior work and use text embeddings, rather than \
learned class embeddings, in the output layer of the classification head [2]. The \
text embeddings, which we call queries, are obtained by passing category names \
or other textual object descriptions through the text encoder. The task of the \
model then becomes to predict, for each object, a bounding box and a probability \
with which each query applies to the object. Queries can be different for each \
image. In effect, each image therefore has its own discriminative label space, \
which is defined by a set of text strings. This approach subsumes classical closed-vocabulary \
object detection as the special case in which the complete set of object category names is used as query set for each image. \
<br>&emsp;&emsp;In contrast to several other methods [26,20], we do not combine all queries \
for an image into a single token sequence. Instead, each query consists of a separate token sequence which represents an individual object description, and is \
individually processed by the text encoder. In addition, our architecture includes \
no fusion between image and text encoders. Although early fusion seems intuitively beneficial, it dramatically reduces inference efficiency because encoding \
a query requires a forward pass through the entire image model and needs to \
be repeated for each image/query combination. In our setup, we can compute \
query embeddings independently of the image, allowing us to use thousands of \
queries per image, many more than is possible with early fusion [26].</br></br> \
<b>One or Few-Shot Transfer.</b> Our setup does not require query embeddings to \
be of textual origin. Since there is no fusion between image and text encoders, we \
can supply image- instead of text-derived embeddings as queries to the classification head without modifying the model. By using embeddings of prototypical \
object images as queries, our model can thus perform image-conditioned oneshot object detection. Using image embeddings as queries allows detection of \
objects which would be hard to describe in text. \

        '<p align="justify"><b>Image-Level Contrastive Pre-Training.</b> We pre-train the image and text \
encoder contrastively using the same image-text dataset and loss as in [44] (Figure 1, left). We train both encoders from scratch with random initialization\
with a contrastive loss on the image and text representations. For the image \
representation, we use multihead attention pooling (MAP) [25,43] to aggregate \
token representation. The text representation is obtained from the final end-ofsequence (EOS) token of the text encoder. \
Alternatively, we use publicly available pre-trained CLIP models [33] (details in Appendix A1.3). \
<br>&emsp;&emsp;An advantage of our encoder-only architecture is that nearly all of the model\'s \
parameters (image and text encoder) can benefit from image-level pre-training. \
 The detection-specific heads contain at most 1.1% (depending on the model size)</br></br> \
<b>Training the Detector.</b> Fine-tuning of pre-trained models for <i>classification</i> is \
a well-studied problem. Classifiers, especially large Transformers, require carefully tuned regularization and \
data augmentation to perform well. Recipes for classifier training are now well established in the literature [39,38,3]. Here, we \
aim to provide a similar fine-tuning recipe for <i>open-vocabulary detection</i>. \
<br>&emsp;&emsp;The general detection training procedure of our model is almost identical to \
that for closed-vocabulary detectors, except that we provide the set of object \
category names as queries for each image. The classification head therefore outputs logits over the per-image label space defined by the queries, rather than a \
fixed global label space. \
<br>&emsp;&emsp;We use the bipartite matching loss introduced by DETR [6], but adapt it \
to long-tailed/open-vocabulary detection as follows. Due to the effort required \
for annotating detection datasets exhaustively, datasets with large numbers of \
classes are annotated in a federated manner [13,24]. Such datasets have nondisjoint label spaces, which means that each object can have multiple labels. We \
therefore use focal sigmoid cross-entropy [48] instead of softmax cross-entropy \
as the classification loss. Further, since not all object categories are annotated \
in every image, federated datasets provide both positive (present) and negative \
(known to be absent) annotations for each image. During training, for a given \
image, we use all its positive and negative annotations as queries. Additionally, \
we randomly sample categories in proportion to their frequency in the data and \
add them as “pseudo-negatives” to have at least 50 negatives per image [47]. \
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Even the largest federated detection datasets contain only ≈ 10<sup>6</sup> \
images, which is small in contrast to the billions of image-level weak labels which exist \
of the parameters of the model.\
