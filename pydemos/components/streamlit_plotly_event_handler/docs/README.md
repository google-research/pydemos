# Streamlit - Relayout Event Handler for Plotly

## Description

The objective of this component is to provide a handler for relayout events in
Plotly plots.

Relayout events are those that consist of a change in the plot's layout,
i.e. the addition of a shape or annotation.

The component will get a Plotly figure from Streamlit, render it and listen to
relayout events. On happening, the component will capture the coordinates of the
annotation or shape drawn in the plot and will return them in a dictionary.
